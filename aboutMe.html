            <h2>Hi, I'm Bas</h2>
            <p>
                Kia Ora all! My name is Sebastian Chapman, but I normally go by Seb or Bas.
                I’ve been living down in Queenstown for the last few years and am originally from the mighty Manawatu.

                As for something about my values, I have two that drive me. Firstly, I think mental health is a
                monumental issue in our day and age, and the thing that I value the most and has personally helped me a
                lot is taking care of
                some of the very human needs that we all have. Those needs that I value are the following: Taking time
                to be in nature,
                exercising, being social and being part of a community. My other core driving value does rely on the
                first one being in place so that
                it can function. The world we live in is facing the biggest challenges in its history with the war
                against climate change
                and without having healthy, happy, fully function humans, we won’t have a fighting chance. Which leads
                me onto my other driving
                value. The principal of creating economic systems that heal and nurture the planet and all the
                ecosystems that
                find themselves at home on this flying rock.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of that leads to why I’m here at Dev-Academy! I believe tech provides the biggest lever to make a
                difference on both of those fronts. Learning how to code will hopefully give me a good set of tools to
                have a crack at making a difference,
                and hey, even if I don’t manage to, coding can be a pretty fun way to spend your days!
