                I believe everyone has the right to live a the life of a human.<br />
                That may sound like stating the obvious a bit but let’s have a look at what I mean. In the world we live
                in
                the rates of depression and anxiety are on the rise. Now, the human genome has been evolving for
                millions of
                years and yet only in recent times has mental health been such a monumental issue. We’ve been told to
                think
                that everyone who walks through the doctors door can be sent away with a jar of medication and they’ll
                be
                fine, that just doesn’t seam right to me. Surely millions of years of evolution can’t have got it that
                wrong. I wonder if just like how we need sunlight for vitamin D production maybe we need a whole stack
                of
                other things as well. Maybe every human deserves a right to nature? Maybe they deserve a right to be
                social,
                a right to be a part of a community. Maybe they deserve a right to be creative, to build things, and to
                work
                as a team.

                Positioning is a way of telling the browser how we want our elements to interact with the viewport. The
                different position values allow our elements to take on a range of positioning behaviours.

                Long term goal is to create business(s) that restructure economic models to provide carbon negative and
                all round environmentally positive out comes. How I see that pathway looking takes a few forms. On the
                tech
                side, I’d like to work with some frameworks like Gatsby or next.js. Now I’m in two schools of thought on
                how
                I approach this. Do i seek out work in an agency, hoping to get a wide range of builds, or should i seek
                out
                a start up that is building a scalable product? Supplementary to this is developing my own blog (which
                i’ve
                started doing in Gatsby) that I speak to people out there already doing it. The thing that gets me
                excited
                about that is that I love talking to people passionate about the same things. Crucial to that is
                developing
                written and spoken sales and communication skills.
