                I believe everyone has the right to live a the life of a human.<br />
                That may sound like stating the obvious a bit but let’s have a look at what I mean. In the world we live
                in
                the rates of depression and anxiety are on the rise. Now, the human genome has been evolving for
                millions of
                years and yet only in recent times has mental health been such a monumental issue. We’ve been told to
                think
                that everyone who walks through the doctors door can be sent away with a jar of medication and they’ll
                be
                fine, that just doesn’t seam right to me. Surely millions of years of evolution can’t have got it that
                wrong. I wonder if just like how we need sunlight for vitamin D production maybe we need a whole stack
                of
                other things as well. Maybe every human deserves a right to nature? Maybe they deserve a right to be
                social,
                a right to be a part of a community. Maybe they deserve a right to be creative, to build things, and to
                work
                as a team.

                    between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</a></h3>

                Positioning is a way of telling the browser how we want our elements to interact with the viewport. The
                different position values allow our elements to take on a range of positioning behaviours.

                Long term goal is to create business(s) that restructure economic models to provide carbon negative and
                all round environmentally positive out comes. How I see that pathway looking takes a few forms. On the
                tech
                side, I’d like to work with some frameworks like Gatsby or next.js. Now I’m in two schools of thought on
                how
                I approach this. Do i seek out work in an agency, hoping to get a wide range of builds, or should i seek
                out
                a start up that is building a scalable product? Supplementary to this is developing my own blog (which
                i’ve
                started doing in Gatsby) that I speak to people out there already doing it. The thing that gets me
                excited
                about that is that I love talking to people passionate about the same things. Crucial to that is
                developing
                written and spoken sales and communication skills.

            <h3><a class="article-heading" href="/blog/technicalBlogs/sprint3_technical.html"> HTML, CSS, JS, Frankenstein, and the DOM</h3>
            <h6 class="article-date">18/02/2020</h6>
            <p>Once upon a time, in a little Bavarian town, somewhere at the bottom of a mountain, lived a man known by
                the
                name of Dr. Frankenstein. Dr. Frankenstein was a tech savvy web dev, living his days just tinkering away on an old banged up
                MacBook
                pro. The Dr lived alone, and although he had many friends on reddit he was starting to long for someone
                a
                bit closer to home. One day, he got a crazy idea... What if I could create a human within my web
                browser, to
                live with me and keep me from getting lonely...? So he opened up VS code and started hacking away at the
                keyboard “Typing noises”. First thing, he types up a head, then slaps on a body, chucks in a few asides
                and
                finally adds a footer. Dr Frankenstein, shaking from excitement opens up the browser to see his new
                friend,
                but what does he see?</p>

            <h3><a class="article-heading" href="/blog/coreBlogs/sprint3-cultural.html">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <h6 class="article-date">18/02/2020</h6>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is the intelligence that is based around social interaction. We, the humans, are
                social creatures and so much of our lives, happiness and success in this world can be traced back to how
                we
                interact with one's own emotions, and consequently our actions which become our interactions.</p>
