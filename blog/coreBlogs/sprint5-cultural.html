            <h3>Here are three new things I’ve learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning.</h3>

            <p>Don’t let your ego fool you into thinking you are “smart”. I Think at high school, I was definitely
                someone with a fixed mindset. I was in top classes which made me think “Oh i must be smart, at some
                things at least”. Hindsight now can let me see that I was just lucky to grow up in a household that
                valued education. Where the ego really came in to bite me was when I first came across calculus. In the
                NZ school system, it felt like there wasn’t any challenge up until that point, but when I hit that
                point… Boy oh boy was I in for a shock. I think the teenage me blamed my teachers and the system. In
                reality I just needed to put in the work. Me thinking I was “smart” at math really screwed me when I
                came up against a new challenge. I flunked that course. Then seven years later, and now an adult who had
                travelled the world and seen that there're a million different forms of intelligence. I’d seen that the
                only thing that matters is putting in the work ( Understanding things like neuroplasticity help ). I
                took a uni paper that covered calculus, without an ego in the way thinking everything else is wrong I
                aced the
                paper and more importantly understood “What” calculus is (still would need to refer to formulas in the
                way a programmer might look up docs). So when it comes to bootcamp, and programing
                in the future, I’ll understand that I am nether “smart” nor “dumb” I am just yet to learn.</p>

            <p>Within the core learnings, the active listening was a key area of development for me. After reading the
                best selling book, How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, a few years ago, I have
                been conscious about being an active listener in day to day life, but I do often find myself chiming in
                with little things, mainly a confirmation of what the other person is saying. By doing the exercise and
                waiting completely until the other person has finished talking before responding I feel like I have
                further developed that skill. It forces you to be even more attentive when listening and makes you
                really try to understand what the other person is saying concisely, which of course benefits both people
                involved.
                The last main take away from the foundations core work was from at the start where we identified our
                values. By putting them into words and writing it to be consumed by the fellow classmates, it really
                forces you to think hard, and write in a way to be understood. For me I plan on
                iterating over my values a few more times and getting a full piece written up on my personal blog.</p>

            <p>For me personally, my values are what drive me and help get me through the hard times. They are also
                something that helps me have a grounding for when I’m getting off track. </p>

            <p>Us humans are social animals,
                so empathy and self awareness are two things that are essential for having healthy social relationships.
                In a discipline like programming where you come up against hard problems, and work with a wide range of
                people across businesses, being able to build relationships and have healthy communication are key.
                The thing that has surprised me the most about the core learning is just how much I’ve enjoyed it, and
                look forward to developing it for the rest of my life.
            </p>
            <p>As far as challenging aspects go, I really did find it all so enjoyable that it wasn’t a challenge. Often
                when trying to write it’s hard for me to get going, but it really was super enjoyable and took out any
                of what some might call “challenge” from it.</p>

            <p>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.

                As for if I feel like the core learning was a waste of time or not, and if we should have just been
                programing instead?

                I think that its definitely not a waste of time. On one side, it’s a great way to produce content for
                our work. It's been something that myself and hopefully others
                have been enjoying doing, and want to put together as part of our blogs. On the other side, I think
                programming is really hard at times, and without these core skills it’s going to be really hard to stick
                through it. One final point, I think it is in everyone’s best interest. If the students learn all these
                core skills, and become better happier people, and the people employing them are happy with them, and
                the people around them are happy with them, it benefits everybody, including Dev Academy which is going
                to be more likely to get more enrolments and more employment directly from it. A superb alignment of
                incentives.</p>

            <p>
                In absolutely no way do I feel like this is a waste of time. When learning a new skill like programming,
                that can be incredibly cognitively demanding, breaking up the workload with writing allows productive
                rest time. I find It’s a great way to nurture flow states also, which channel over to programming. As
                with everything I’ve said above, I think it all fits in together, and hopefully will deliver some great
                results. </p>
