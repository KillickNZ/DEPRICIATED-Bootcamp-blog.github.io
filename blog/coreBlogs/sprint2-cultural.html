            <h3>What is my long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>Long term goal is to create business(s) that restructure economic models to provide carbon negative and
                all round environmentally positive out comes. How I see that pathway looking takes a few forms. On the
                tech
                side, I’d like to work with some frameworks like Gatsby or next.js. Now I’m in two schools of thought on
                how
                I approach this. Do i seek out work in an agency, hoping to get a wide range of builds, or should i seek
                out
                a start up that is building a scalable product? Supplementary to this is developing my own blog (which
                i’ve
                started doing in Gatsby) that I speak to people out there already doing it. The thing that gets me
                excited
                about that is that I love talking to people passionate about the same things. Crucial to that is
                developing
                written and spoken sales and communication skills.
            </p>
            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see develop while at EDA?</h3>
            <p>I think I’d like to get better at crystallising my understanding of concepts and get to a point where i
                can communicate them clearly in as little words as possible. I feel sometimes I brain vomit on people
                and
                they probably loose interest or feel lost on what i’m trying to explain. One thing that I’v e found that
                helps with that is journalling. Ofter I find i have a feeling of understanding, but its not until i
                write it
                down that it forms a solid foundation of understand in my head.</p>

            <p>The other human skill i’d like to work on is public speaking. Again i’ve found the journalling of
                concepts
                before talking to be helpful. But more experience building the muscle to think on my toes while public
                speaking is one thing i’d love to work on.</p>
            <h3>A description of my own strengths and limitations</h3>

            <p>Firstly, I’m not sure I should write personally about my strengths, but if I had to say one, It would be
                question asking. I’ve spent the last 5 years project managing for a construction company and dealing
                with
                sub contractors all day has honed my question asking skills. I was in the position to have a broad
                overview
                of the job while doing that which did give me an advantage, but hopefully i can translate that over in
                to
                working as a developer.</p>
            <p>Limitations... Where do I start haha I think if you asked my girlfriend you may get a better answer. But
                I
                guess If I did have to say the public speaking is one of the big ones. Also finding the balance between
                listening and being involved in the conversation, I hate feeling like i’ve cut someone off mid sentence,
                but
                sometimes the excitement of an idea surges through you and bursts out. Finding a way to best communicate
                and
                navigate that scenario is one limitation. Grammar is one other weakness, although I am conscious about
                the
                ways in which to get better, I’ve found the quickest way to get my writing into shape is to work with
                someone who is a pro at grammar for the editing stage. Tech wise, I think front end is a big weakness at
                the
                moment. And given that the frameworks I want to work with are ones that render front end code, I feel
                like
                the roles of front end and backend are merged into more full stack development.</p>
            <h3>
                Based on the above description, a commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.
            </h3>



            <p>if you are familiar with the book, the art of learning, by Josh Waizkin then you’ll be familiar with the
                ritual. This is about finding your process to get into a flow zone. Josh describes this ritual much the
                same
                as a lot of other authors, where to get into the flow zone, first thing in the morning you want a bit of
                movement, not a heavy weight session as they can make you tired but some cardio or something or
                something
                thats not going to leave you exhausted. Then, there’s a period of social interaction (if ya real good,
                you
                can wrap the movement and social into one), for me ofter this include grabbing a coffee and a yarn with
                a
                mate or work mate. Then the final key, the one that Josh does different to other people is listen to a
                song,
                and let it be the same some everyday. The Idea is that eventually, once you’ve engrained this ritual, if
                you
                ever need to channel focus then you trigger the benefits of the whole ritual by just listening to the
                song
                and again, if ya real good just thinking about it. So for me personally, If for bootcamp I can find a
                place
                to live in wellington, I’ll be going to the gym first thing, if I have to train from my mums in
                Paraparumu,
                then it’ll have to be a walk from the station. I’ll hopefully find a coffee shop to make my local, en
                route
                to campus, then I’m not sure as to how i get the social part in just yet. Maybe it’s a phone call to a
                distant friend each day, or maybe I get to campus early and have a yarn with my class mate. Then when I
                sit
                down to my computer, I have my ritual song to get me in the flow state, while i listen to that i’m not
                working, more so tidying my workspace up to prepare, then put on some white noise on repeat and rip into
                it.
                That all being said, this system works best for deep work, the hard coding, however thats not the only
                part
                of the job. The collaboration is the other side of the picture. I haven’t particularly used the ritual
                to
                approach collaborative work be for, but I imagine I could adapt it in some way or another. Working with
                other people too, I alway try to be mindful while communicating. This can be hard when one is tired, so
                for
                me nurturing the things that allow me to perform and not get as tired, like sleep, exercise, and eating
                healthy are key to performing well. Also, recharging my social battery. I guess by nature i’m somewhat
                of an
                introvert, so sometimes taking 20min to lie down on my bed alone makes all the difference when it comes
                to
                communicating well.</p>

            <h3>A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way.</h3>

            <p>This is something I think I have only recently started to think about. How I would like my help seeking
                process to go is to first ask my rubber duck for help, see if by just explaining what it is in need help
                for
                in my head to my little mate ducky, if I will be able to work through the problem. Then if i’m still in
                need
                of help, I think I will go to the forums, just assuming here but, I wonder if peer to peer, working out
                a
                problem delivers better retention than asking a teacher...? And then the final stop will be to ask the
                facilitator if all other steps fail or are dragging out the time to where I think it’s beneficial to
                ask.
            </p>
            <h3>A description of what I expect from the facilitation team</h3>

            <p>Motivation, inspiration, the foresight to point us in a direction for our projects to build things that
                in
                the real world would have a lot of risk attached to them.</p>
            <p>No requirements for scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things
            </p>
