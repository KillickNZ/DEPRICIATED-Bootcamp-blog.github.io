            <h3>What my personal values are:</h3>

            <p>I believe everyone has the right to live a the life of a human.</p>
            <p>That may sound like stating the obvious a bit but let’s have a look at what I mean. In the world we live
                in
                the rates of depression and anxiety are on the rise. Now, the human genome has been evolving for
                millions of
                years and yet only in recent times has mental health been such a monumental issue. We’ve been told to
                think
                that everyone who walks through the doctors door can be sent away with a jar of medication and they’ll
                be
                fine, that just doesn’t seam right to me. Surely millions of years of evolution can’t have got it that
                wrong. I wonder if just like how we need sunlight for vitamin D production maybe we need a whole stack
                of
                other things as well. Maybe every human deserves a right to nature? Maybe they deserve a right to be
                social,
                a right to be a part of a community. Maybe they deserve a right to be creative, to build things, and to
                work
                as a team.</p>
            <p>Thats what I mean when I say one of my values is that humans deserve the right to be human.</p>



            <p>The world we live in is facing the biggest challenges in its history with the war against climate change,
                and without having healthy, happy, fully function humans, we won’t have a fighting chance. Which leads
                me
                onto my other driving value. The principal of creating economic systems that heal and nurture the planet
                and
                all the ecosystems that find themselves at home on this flying rock. I strongly believe that technology
                gives us our best fighting chance to re-structure our society. It’s given us the way to communicate in a
                bottom up way to the world. It gives us the opportunity to re-structure assets to be carbon positive,
                and
                hopefully with the blood sweat and tears of you, me and anyone else foolish enough to take a swing at
                it, we
                will replace some of the chemical technologies we’ve seen reek destruction on our plant in the 20th
                century.</p>
            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the
                values
                involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took:</h3>
            <p>In regards to an ethical decision, I’ll give one that I made recently. To eat primarily hunted meat. One
                of the values that was front of mind was how If buying a piece of meat from the supermarket there is
                little
                to no way of knowing the origin of it, how near or close that may be, the way the animal was raised, the
                way
                the farm was being run, sustainably or not and the nutrition of it. I had to put that up against the
                monumental amount of effort involved with finding, shooting, retrieving and butchering a wild animal.
                But
                the decision was made, the work put in, and now I’m reaping the benefits of it. Because I don’t have to
                buy
                meat often, when I do, I can afford to get fresh organic products.</p>

            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:</h3>



            <p>My culture stems from growing up in rural NZ, and then being part of a very tight nit mountain bike
                community, here in NZ and overseas. The growing up rural part is probably what stemmed my love and
                respect
                of nature. The mountain biking world has given me so much to be thankful for. A group of mates all
                spanning
                around the world, A lifestyle that incorporates getting into the bush, exercise, taking risks and being
                social all wrapped up in one extremely fun activity! The MTB community is made up of a lot of deserters.
                People who were going through the motions in life, got the job, got married, got the house, did all the
                thing we were told would make us happy but were left yearning for something more. The community is made
                up
                with people who were curious enough to give something else a go and never looked back. I talk to a lot
                of
                people who ride that were living a “normal” life and were depressed (myself included). What riding gave
                them, the time in nature, exercise, friends and community were things that cured that depression. I
                consider
                myself lucky to be able to look see how these things effect myself and the people around me and
                defiantly
                see now how strongly the community has shaped my values.</p>
            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</h3>
            <p>According to the 16 personalities test, I fit into what they describe as an Advocate. Which is apparently
                the rarest personality type. Would be curious to know how many other advocates are attracted to
                programming?
                So that talks somewhat to what my strengths and weaknesses should be. If was to say my strengths it
                would be
                to view things from a broad fundamental perspective. I think this may have developed from growing up,
                and
                working out of school on a farm. You see that everything works together in some way or another. In the
                past
                this has served me in ways that i’ve been able to set up systems for operation within companies that
                have
                saved time and money. Another area where this helps is in sales, being able to understand the
                fundamentals
                of a clients problem and provide them with a solution that is the best ROI (and ofter solve more of
                their
                issues that they weren’t looking to solve in the first place, or even knew were there or connected).</p>
            <p>As for weaknesses, single handedly my biggest one is public speaking. I’ve found it especially hard if I
                haven’t sunk a lot of time into become proficient on what ever it is i’m speaking about. It’s something
                I am
                cognizant about working on, and have started developing a structure to help, but ultimately i just need
                to
                do more if it.</p>

            <p>Another weakness is that i’m a shocker for skim reading. I’ve done this while debugging and got so
                frustrated, thinking there’s got to be some sort of big harry logic bug somewhere, only to find i’ve
                spelt a
                variable wrong. So I try to slow down and read purposefully, but is 100% a weakness.</p>

            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect
                with
                learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p>I’d like to think that I can think systematically about the most efficient ways to build things, but that
                will take a lot of trial and error to get to a point of competence. One thing I have been trying to do
                is
                exercise humility. to embrace the suck! What I mean by that is when you’re a beginner, unless you have
                some
                god given gift at something, chances are you are going to suck, so embrace it! Learning how to
                communicate
                from a point of suck without letting ego get in the way is a key to learning that i’m trying to actively
                be
                conscious about. Not sure it’s really a strength, but for me at least i’ve found it valuable.</p>



            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but
                there
                was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and
                your
                reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>

            <p>The time’s when there has been conflict, in recent years i’ve tried to have a bit more fun with it.
                Instead
                of arguing back and forth, I like to put a wager on it. “$5 says my button performs better than yours”.
                People have different tastes, and ways of doing things, but sometimes doing a little A/B test with yours
                and the person who you’re working withs idea, chucking a friendly bet on it, and seeing what the data
                says
                as to what performs better is a fun way to handle things without getting tensions high. Also a friendly
                wager requires someone to be confident enough in their though process to risk money on it. Sometimes
                that
                alone will defuse the issue.</p>

            <p>One other thing I do when encountering a conflict is just simply let the person get it all out. We don’t
                have to respond to everything. And 100% of the time, when someone has been in a point of anger at work,
                voiced their opinion in a dramatic manner, they have come back after cooling off and tend to see things
                from
                both sides and apologies for any behavior they’re not all too proud of.</p>
