            <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset Blog</h3>
            <p>The power of Neuroplasticity. Simply understanding the principles of a growth mindsets helps multiply the
                effects of neuroplasticity on
                the brain. When children in schools are told that the brain is malleable and not fixed their performance
                Improves. So what’s actually happening in your brain? When learning a new thing your brain can create
                new
                brain cells, It also builds new electrical pathways called neural networks that are the ways in which
                the
                brain communicates with itself. Those networks can either be strengthened, by the building up of myelin,
                the
                coating around the pathways. Or, old pathways can be removed in a process called synaptic pruning. I.e.
                “If
                ya don’t use it, you lose it!”</p>
            <p>As far as how I plan on engaging neuroplasticity principles for my own benefit goes, In the technical
                world
                and learning to code, I think it’s provided me extra patience for working through problems. It’s removed
                the
                thought from my brain that used to say “I can’t do this”. Then, maybe in the more profound way in how it
                will affect my EQ is I think with being mindful, and seeing my short falls, I’ll be able to to work on,
                one,
                figuring out what pathways have been built up and why. And two, what I want the new ones to be and how
                do I
                build them.</p>
            <p>One of the first things that popped up while doing my research on the interwebs was about finding your
                passions and goals through mindfulness. This then allows you an avenue to passionately develop, and
                reinforce positive brain waves. For example if you're doing stuff you don’t want to be doing every day,
                It’s
                going to reinforce negative brain waves. Whereas if you are doing something that you love, you are going
                to
                choose to try and learn new things in that domain.</p>

            <p>That then leads into the next “Pro tip” for developing Neuroplasticity. Depth and breadth.
                Doing something you love, and honing that in provides the Depth which is essential for building the
                string
                neural pathways, but we also need breadth. That can be something like taking a martial arts class, doing
                something new with arts or having one night a week where you cook a new meal.</p>

            <p>One thing that in this day and age, with endless content rammed down our throats is extremely important
                is
                controlling your circle of influence. That can mean curating your social feeds, and limiting exposure.
                It
                can also mean being selective with the people you spend time with. You want to create a focused world
                that
                allows space and support to learn with depth.</p>


            <p>The last key pointer that I’ve come across is Aerobic exercise. It increases blood flow to the brain and
                strengthens pathways. Personally I’ve found this to be a huge one for developing discipline. By roping
                myself into an event, and then training for and having to do the event I have been able to build that
                discipline mental muscle and strengthen it. Through sport I’ve also read a lot of sport books with
                pointers
                to learning skills at a high level. Things like the Wim hoff method develops discipline by forcing
                yourself
                into ice cold water every day. Middle of winter and already cold? Doesn’t matter, get in. Need to train
                today so you don’t suffer or do poorly on race day, but you’re just not feeling like moving? Sorry,
                you’ve
                booked in for this. Get out and train. One thing that the sports world talks more about than the world
                of
                developing neuroplasticity is recovery. It’s something that’s taken as seriously as the training. Making
                sure you are eating well and getting all the nutrients to recover. Fitting in fasting into the programs
                for
                removing translucent cells from the body (Zombie cells) I wonder what is going to come out in the next
                3-5
                years around the recovery needed for the brain to maximize neural development. Things like walks in
                nature
                without any devices or inputs, just the world around us? Another thing athletes do is break down the
                performance of top performers, diving into the Micro to understand the Macro. I have heard of people
                using
                this approach in mental pursuits as well as athletic, but maybe it’s more prominent in the sports world
                because one can literally view what is going on, and doesn't have to probe into the mind as one would to
                learn the micro techniques of a top performer in a mental discipline.</p>




            <h3>The Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>The way I look at the growth mindset is that it is the implementation of neuroplasticity. The growth
                mindset
                is the principle of knowing that one can learn, and not thinking that one is fixed in place, for
                whatever
                aspect of their life. By having a growth mindset you free the mind to learn, It becomes a license to
                being
                patient with oneself. A license to being able to ask for help. It stops the fixed mindset views that a
                lot
                of people (Including my former self) have. Those fixed views can be at both ends of the spectrum. They
                can
                be a view that “I’m good at math”, or at the other end “Oh, I’m not good at english”
                At both ends they are damaging. Obviously at the end where someone thinks they cant do something because
                they’re “Just not good at it” it’s going to hinder their ability to learn new skills, because they’ve
                already shut that door. And at the other end, where people think they have innate skills for something,
                they
                will inevitably come up against challenges that will be too much, and they will blame outside inputs. Or
                they may, if in competition come up against someone that has developed more skills than them and then
                they
                won't be able to learn and adapt.</p>
            <p>One of the things that I am implementing personally is my goals and journaling system to allow for
                growth.</p>
            <p>I have a set of goals that I read every day as part of a journal template I have created. Seeing the
                goals
                every day, and also setting daily ones helps hugely for keeping on track for the area I want to grow in.
                Here is an example of what the template looks like:</p>

                {<br>

                }<br>

                thing in the day. I use this as a place to come to if I ever need a place for a stream of

            <p>If the idea of using a template sounds like something you’d be into, Day One is a free journal tool that
                allows custom templates.</p>

            <p>For integrating all of this knowledge into my learning plan while here at bootcamp, The main point of
                integration I see is in the area of strengths and weaknesses. I think the strengths side of things it’s
                probably easier to let a fixed mindset sneak its way in. So remembering all of this research and staying
                humble in strengths, keeping humility on the table. And then on the weaknesses allowing myself the time
                to
                work on breaking down problems, knowing that at a micro level, nearly everything is simple and
                understandable (Maybe quantum physics might be an exception) and that you just have to build back up
                from
                the micro. Checking any assumptions along the way.
