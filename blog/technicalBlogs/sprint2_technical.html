                Positioning is a way of telling the browser how we want our elements to interact with the viewport. The
                different position values allow our elements to take on a range of positioning behaviours.
            </p>
            <p>
                The position properties look like this:

            <h3>Different types:</h3>
            <h3>static</h3>
            <p></p>
            Static is the positioning element that all elements start off with by default on the page. If we’re thinking
            about
            elements as a block of pixels, static just means it will display in its normal form. The static property
            is the default property so the only time we would declare it would be if it were to overwrite a property
            declaration made by a parent element. To try and make an attempt at an analogy, the static element acts
            like
            a still photo frame of your family (without you in it...).
            </p>

            <h3>Absolute</h3>
            <p>
                This position property lets you place items literally wherever you want on the page. With the use of
                top,
                bottom, left and right you can position the item in the exact spot you want. The Absolute element does
                have
                a higher Z-index than static element’s, however you can use the z-index property to get the element to
                display at the desired depth. An analogy for the absolute position value would be, if you took the still
                photo from the above static positioning analogy, then got a pin and a cut out photo of
                yourself and pinned it where ever you wanted on the image of you’re family which you didn’t make the cut
                for
                the first time.
            </p>

            <h3>Fixed</h3>
            <p>
                Fixed is exactly what it sounds like. The element is fixed within the viewport of the display. Ever
                noticed how some header nav’s stay in place as you scroll down the page? Thats a fixed position element.
                An
                example best portrays the fixed element because there’s one right there. not there, up there. Your
                browser
                top bar acts in the way a fixed element would within a web page. (Also the heading for this blog post!)
            </p>

            <h3>Relative</h3>
            <p>
                Relative is an element I have had trouble with in the past, but in my research for this post I can
                across
                a line that was very simple, thats helped me understand how it works. Relative means to be relative to
                itself.
                So naturally, a relative element won’t appear any different to itself in a static form if nothing else is done. It is not until
                we
                use the position properties top, bottom, left, right and z-index that it starts to take on its relative
                position. So for example, if you wanted to move a button up from the bottom of where it is currently,
                you
                could set the css rules :  .className {  position: relative;  bottom: 5vh; }
            </p>

            <h3>Sticky</h3>
            <p>
                The sticky position property acts somewhat like a mix between a static element and a fixed, where in
                it
                will follow the flow of the page scroll, until it runs out of room, then it will remain fixed at the
                down
                stream point of the scroll flow until the container element it is within has been scrolled passed. An example
                of
                this may be on an online paper, where the name and page of the paper may be displayed at the top, and
                while
                you scroll down that page it will display that info, until you reach the next page where its name and
                new
                page number will make its way up the display and take its place at the top.
