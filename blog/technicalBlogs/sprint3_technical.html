            <h2>Here is a story about HTML and CSS…</h2>

            <h2>The Story of Frankenstein’s HTML and CSS monster.</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, in a little Bavarian town, somewhere at the bottom of a mountain, lived a man known by
                the
                name of Dr. Frankenstein.</p>
            <p>Dr. Frankenstein was a tech savvy web dev, living his days just tinkering away on an old banged up
                MacBook
                pro. The Dr lived alone, and although he had many friends on reddit he was starting to long for someone
                a
                bit closer to home. One day, he got a crazy idea... What if I could create a human within my web
                browser, to
                live with me and keep me from getting lonely...? So he opened up VS code and started hacking away at the
                keyboard “Typing noises”. First thing, he types up a head, then slaps on a body, chucks in a few asides
                and
                finally adds a footer. Dr Frankenstein, shaking from excitement opens up the browser to see his new
                friend,
                but what does he see? Nothing but the bare bones of his new friend. Devastated and wondering where he
                gone
                wrong he took off to his study to bury himself in stackoverflow, determined to find a way to bring his
                new
                friend to life. Weeks past, when he stumbles across a little link, barely still clickable. It takes him
                to
                W3schools.com where he finds a little tool they are referring to as CSS. Excited again, Dr Frankenstein
                heads to his computer and starts typing away “Excessively loud typing noises”.</p>

            <p>“I’ve done it!” He says to himself! He does his final commit and pushes his code to github. Once again,
                riddled with excitement he opens the browser, heads to his github and opens the github pages file called
                newFriend.html and there she is! Dr. Frankenstein’s new friend. She has long blonde hair, a green dress
                on,
                and little red ribbon on her head. The Dr is Exceptionally excited, he tells all his friends about her,
                and
                can’t wait to introduce her. But soon he notices, somethings wrong. When he says hello, or clicks on her
                she
                doesn’t move or do anything. It seems she’s not alive. So Dr. Frankenstein heads back to stackoverflow
                to
                see what he can do to give life to his new found friend... That part of the story will have to wait
                until
                the next chapter.</p>
                <h3>Control flows and Loops.</h3>
            <p>The next thing I would like to comment on are two core principles of coding. Control flows and Loops.
                Control flow helps you determine when and what parts of the program are run. Loops are a way of
                repeating
                code until a certain condition is met. Here are a few pseudo code examples of different control flows
                and
                loops</p>

            <p>For (item : itemsOfWashing){<br>
                &#9;hangItem()<br>
                &#9;}</p>

            <p> DishesClean = false;<br>
                &#9;While( !DishesClean)<br>
                &#9;washDishes()
            </p>

            <p> If (leavingHouse){<br>
                &#9;If (lightOn){<br>
                &#9;&#9;turnLightOff()<br>
                &#9;&#9;}
                &#9;}</p>

            <p>If (bored && tired ) { <br>
                &#9;readABook<br>
                &#9; }<br>
                Else if (bored && !tired ) {<br>
                &#9;goForARun()<br>
                &#9;}</p>

            <h3>A description what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>

            <p>The DOM is essentially a tree like structure for accessing and manipulating the content of your web page.
                It
                treats HTML and XML elements as nodes and objects which allows for the nodes to have parent, child and
                sibling nodes. The following image gives a good representation:</p>

            <img src="/resources/DOM.png" alt="DOM Image">

            <p> An explanation of the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
                Arrays are ordered objects and can be accessed using a numbered reference, starting from zero. For
                example
                array[0] will get the first item in the array, while array[9] would return the tenth. Objects however
                have
                Key - Value pairs and you can look up an individual object by searching for its key. Everyday life is
                full
                of objects which essentially act in the same way. For example a human, it has a hair property, height,
                eye
                colour etc. and object for a human might look like the following:</p>
            <p> Const Human = {<br>
                &#9;Name : “Seb”,<br>
                &#9;Height : 158,<br>
                &#9; EyeColor : “Blue”<br>
                &#9;Interests : [ “Coding”, “Economics”, “Mountain Biking”, “Climbing”, “Hunting” ]<br>
                &#9;}</p>

            <p>As you can see an object can hold properties of all data types (including other objects). To access Seb’s
                eye color, you can use ether dot or bracket notations. Dot notation would look like the following:
                Human.EyeColor while bracket notation would look like human[‘EyeColor’]</p>

            <p>Now onto functions.
                Functions are a way of organising code and making it repeatable. They generally take an input and return
                an
                output. It is considered good practice for the input to not be altered but the function, but rather
                return a
                new object.</p>
