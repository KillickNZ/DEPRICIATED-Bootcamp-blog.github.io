            <h2>Getting Blocked.</h2>

            <p>My story about getting blocked comes down to not using the right operator to evaluate some logic.
                So for quite a while I was stuck on the line if(arr[i].toUpperCase() !== "BUZZ"),
                It took a break down of the problem using console.log() to find out where I had gone wrong.
                The tricky thing with this bug was while the logic read right, the way it was applied wasn’t working.
                What I
                had written was if(!arr[i].toUpperCase() === "BUZZ").
            </p>

            <p> Using the console.log() allowed me to see where the program was running fine up to and where the bug was
                occurring. So then I went through and did some testing again with the console.log() to check if all my
                data
                structures were right. I realized that they were all correct so though it must be something to do with
                the
                logic!? So I change the line if(!arr[i].toUpperCase() === "BUZZ") to if(arr[i].toUpperCase() !== "BUZZ")
                and
                badda bing badda boom. It passed the tests. Here’s the full function below:
            </p>


            <p> function deBee (str){<br>
                var arr = str.split(' ')<br>

                var returnArr = [];<br>
                for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){ if(arr[i].toUpperCase() !=="BUZZ" ){ returnArr.push(arr[i]) }
                    }<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return returnArr.join(" ");
                    }
            </p>
            <p>I tried to solve this problem without googling and just thinking about the logic and what was going on,
                as all the processes needed to solve the problem were things that I was familiar with so I thought it a
                good exercise to take a bit longer and try and figure it out myself. The main thing learnt from this is
                to test that the code you’ve written is doing what you think it should be.
            </p>
            <h2>Solving a problem in an elegant way.</h2>
            <p>An interesting thing I learnt about JS objects in this Kata is that they allow for the use of the “this”
                keyword. In this case It allows the user to get data from within an object to use within a function
                within an object. So to make an analogy (nearly) every house has a spatula, but if you're talking about
                your house with your partner, and someone mentions a spatula, then the one you’re talking about is
                probably the one at home. An Object representation of that would be
                Houses [ <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paulsHouse : {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Address: “42, Wallaby Way, Sydney”,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouse: “Jane”,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SpatulaClean: true<br>
                } ]</p>

            <p>Here if Paul and Jane were having a conversation about who needs to clean the spatula, they’d be talking
                about their spatula at home.
                So if there was a function within the object for if the spatula needs cleaning or not, it might look
                like this: <br>
                Function isSpatulaClean() {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If (this.Spatula === true){<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return “spatula is clean!”<br>
                }<br>
                Else { return “Time to do the dishes” }</p>
            <p>So to use the “this” Keyword to solve the problem rather than creating variables and adding them into a
                string was my elegant solution. It reads well, removes clutter.
                Here is the function:</p>


            <p>for (const athlete in athleteArray){<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;athleteArray[athlete].win = function(){<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(this.name +" won the "+ this.sport +" event!") } } <br>For this problem I did venture
                out
                onto
                google. I wasn’t familiar with storing functions as part of an object within Javascript. That’s
                where I stumbled across the “this” keyword. And the rest is history. Luckily I could apply my
                knowledge of the principle of how the “this” keyword works within the Java language and could
                loosely apply it quite easily.</p>
